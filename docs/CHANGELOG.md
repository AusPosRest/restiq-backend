## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Bill row locking under concurrency (#227): acquire `lockBill` row lock inside transaction for `confirmIntent`, `payShare`, and `payAll` to serialize concurrent payments, prevent duplicate tenders, and avoid unfinalizable tender mismatch states.
- Silent-device alerts run every minute without opening sync health, with one alert per silent period per API process. Recovery or a newer heartbeat permits another alert; timers stop on shutdown and are disabled in tests (#233).
- Production startup requires `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`; development and test environments may omit it (#233).
- An order left open for over 12 hours (the KDS live window, now one shared constant) no longer marks its table occupied on the POS table map or blocks a QR session there (#230). A stopgap: nothing is auto-closed. A QR guest still can't place an order on that table until staff close the leftover order.
