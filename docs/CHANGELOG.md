## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Silent-device alerts run every minute without opening sync health, with one alert per silent period per API process. Recovery or a newer heartbeat permits another alert; timers stop on shutdown and are disabled in tests (#233).
- Production startup requires `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`; development and test environments may omit it (#233).
